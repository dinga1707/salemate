You are a senior product engineer + architect. Build an implementation-ready plan and starter code for an app called **Salemate**.

========================
PRODUCT SUMMARY
========================
Salemate is an Indian, multi-language billing + stock management app for **Android / iOS / Web**, similar to MyBillBook and Zoho Billing.
It must work **offline-first** (minimum functionality even without network), and sync when internet is available.
It is a **subscription-based** product with multiple plans.

Use ONLY the features described below. Do NOT invent new features.

========================
FEATURE SPEC (SOURCE OF TRUTH)
========================
1) Stock Management
- “Stock” = items seller can sell to receiver.
- Each stock item contains: item name, brand, HSN/SAC, unit, GST %, cost price, margin, sell price (= cost price + margin), discount (default 0).
- Add stock via:
  a) Image scan of supplier bill (hard/soft copy): scan image and add items into stock
  b) App-to-app stock transfer:
     - If both seller & receiver are on Salemate:
       - Seller creates transfer request
       - Seller stock reduces and items appear as “in transit”
       - Receiver accepts only after physically receiving items
       - On accept: items move from seller “transit” to receiver stock AND invoice is raised from seller to receiver
       - On reject: items move back to seller stock
  c) Manual add/update/delete stock
- User can view: all items in stock + total stock value
- QR-code based system to enter items (scan QR to add item to invoice/perform)
- Items are stored brand-wise; location is captured from app

2) Templates
- User can choose a billing template from predefined templates

3) Billing (Invoice)
- Generate invoice by adding items + quantity
- HSN/SAC and GST auto-filled from item master
- User can override sell price OR add discount
- Items can be added by scanning product QR code

4) Perform (Proforma)
- Create proforma same as invoice
- Can print OR create app-to-app request to move items to transit and then to receiver stock (similar transfer flow)

5) GST
- Generate GST report for filing online
- Upload report/excel and file GST as per user GST agreement (capture in setup)

6) Future Idea (do not build now, but keep in architecture notes)
- Store marketplace listing
- Consumer app to browse nearby stores, add to cart, order
- Store receives order, packs, marks ready for pickup

7) Subscription Plans
- Free:
  - 10 bills/month
  - manual stock addition only
  - 1 bill template with Salemate watermark
  - 1 login per store
  - generate GST report
- ₹99/month:
  - unlimited bills
  - manual stock addition
  - 1 login per store
  - unlimited proformas
  - can select only ONE template once per year; extra template ₹499
- ₹249/month:
  - all billing features including templates
  - 4 logins per store
- ₹399/month:
  - GST filing
  - income tax filing
  - marketplace

8) Telemetry (Analytics)
- Monthly active users by platform (Android vs iOS vs Web)
- Subscription status paid vs free
- Daily app usage
- Location-wise item sold and brands stored

========================
HARD CONSTRAINTS
========================
- Offline-first: must support creating invoices, viewing stock, and adding manual stock even without internet.
- Sync: when online, data must sync safely without duplicates.
- Multi-language: support language selection + translated UI strings.
- Do not mention Flutter. Avoid over-naming specific vendor tech unless necessary.
- Output must be practical and directly implementable.

========================
WHAT YOU MUST DELIVER
========================
A) Requirements → Modules
- Break the app into clear modules (Auth/Store, Stock, Billing, Proforma, Transfers/Transit, Templates, Subscription, GST Reports/Filing, QR/Scan, Telemetry, Sync).
- For each module: purpose + key screens + core user flows + edge cases.

B) Data Model (Offline + Sync friendly)
- Provide database tables/collections with fields & relationships:
  - Store, User, Role/Login limits
  - Item (stock master), Brand, Location
  - Inventory quantities + valuation
  - Invoice, InvoiceLineItem
  - Proforma, ProformaLineItem
  - TransferRequest, TransferLineItem, Transit states
  - Template
  - SubscriptionPlan, SubscriptionStatus, Entitlements
  - GSTReport, GSTFilingJob
  - TelemetryEvent
- Include indexes, unique constraints, and “conflict resolution strategy” notes.

C) API / Service boundaries
- Define endpoint-like contracts (even if local-first):
  - Create/update items
  - Create invoice, list invoices
  - Create proforma
  - Create transfer request, accept/reject transfer
  - Generate GST report
  - Upload GST report and file (only for eligible plan)
  - Fetch templates based on plan
  - Validate entitlement limits (10 bills/month, logins/store, template rules)
- Include request/response JSON examples for key flows.

D) Offline + Sync strategy
- Local data ownership rules
- Sync queue design
- Idempotency keys
- Conflict handling (same item edited on two devices, transfer accept when offline, etc.)
- Minimal online dependency: define exactly which actions must be online (e.g., subscription validation, filing).

E) Starter implementation in this Replit project
- Create a repo-style folder structure with:
  - /docs (spec notes, flows)
  - /server (API + sync + subscription logic)
  - /client (web UI starter with i18n placeholders)
  - /shared (types, validation, constants, entitlement rules)
  - /db (schema + migrations or models)
  - /scripts (seed, local dev)
- Provide working minimal code that supports:
  1) Item CRUD (manual)
  2) Create Invoice offline (local)
  3) Transfer request lifecycle (create + accept/reject) with transit states
  4) Entitlement check for Free plan (10 invoices/month)
  5) Multi-language string framework stub
  6) Telemetry event logging stub (local capture + sync later)

F) Plan/Entitlements rules
- Encode plan rules cleanly (free/99/249/399) and enforce in code.

========================
QUALITY BAR
========================
- No placeholders like “TODO implement later” for the core flows above.
- Provide clean architecture, readable code, and clear docs.
- Include basic tests for entitlement checks and transfer state transitions.

Now start by:
1) Writing the module breakdown + flows
2) Then the data model
3) Then API contracts
4) Then offline/sync strategy
5) Then generate the folder structure and starter code
